## Overview 
Atliq  Hardware is an Indian company which sells Hardwear products all across India.This company is expanding and facing multiple challenges. Some of the challenges are declining revenues and low profit margins In some areas of the country. In this project ,I tried to build a powerful **Dashboard** with the help of **Power bi**. The dashboard tries to give better insights over the declining  revenue and profit margins.


## Motivation 
In high school i used to work for a sneaker store in Brooklyn. The owner of the store had another eight  stores in different boroughs of New York City.The privately-held sneaker stores in New York City do not have fixed prices on their merchandise, So most of the customers bargained .The owner of the store used to go through the same dilemma. The managers of the store sugarcoat revenue numbers with declining profit margins. Some of his stores had increasing revenues with declining profit margins or vice versa. He did not had Powerful tool like power bi to understand his sales better. 
 
## Technical Aspects

**Power Bi** was used to create interactive dashboards for sales, profit margins etc.
**Data Analysis Expression (DAX)** Formula language was used to define custom calculations for Calculated Columns and for Measures (also known as calculated fields).
